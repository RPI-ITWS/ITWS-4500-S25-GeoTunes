    "description": "Green Island, New York, is a small village with a big industrial past. Once an actual island, it's now connected to the mainland by fill and is located in Albany County just north of Troy. Historically, it was a major site for locomotive manufacturing under the American Locomotive Company (ALCO), which powered both war efforts and commercial rail expansion in the 20th century. Today, Green Island is known for its strong sense of community and progressive municipal energy initiatives. Fun facts: it operates its own power authority and offers some of the lowest electric rates in the region. The village is also home to the headquarters of the bicycle manufacturer Kona."
